	<p><br><br>You are alone in the middle of a dark forest. All you have is the light of your phone to guide you. <br> The battery is on 3%.  You can see a small silver box on the ground, partially covered by leaves.

	<br><br>You hear a branch crack behind you. You spin around, but it's too dark to see anything. <br> Someone, or something, is out here with you.</p>

	<p><a id="box" href="endings/path1.html"> Stop to pick up the box. </a></p>

	<p><a id="walk" href="endings/path2.html"> Who cares about the box, keep walking. </a></p>
